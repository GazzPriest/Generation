##Write a small program that will purposefully throw an exception, causing your program to crash
##Update it to include exception handling with a try-except block
##Update it to print the error generated by the exception
##Add an additional code path in your application which can generate another exception of of a different type and handle it seperately if it occurs
##Add functionality to print out the stack trace for an exception to see where in code it occurs (Hint: traceback)
import traceback

try:
    num = [1,2,3]
    fourth = num[4]
except Exception as e:
    print('Number out of range')
    print(traceback.format_exc())

try:
    dictionary = {'test':'value'}
except Exception as e:
    print('There has been an exception')
    print(e)
